# Azure Terraform Lab – Windows VM Deployment with Variables & Managed Disks

## 📌 Task Description
This lab extends the previous **Windows VM deployment** in Azure.  
The goal is to **replace hardcoded values with variables** and **add managed disks using `for_each`**.  

### Requirements:
- Copy your **previous Windows VM project** and perform all modifications on the copy  
- Replace all hardcoded values with **variables**  
- Provide a **list of used variables**  
- Create **Managed Disks with `for_each`**:
  - **Name:** taken from variable  
  - **Location & Resource Group:** taken from data source  
  - **Storage Account Type:** `Standard_LRS` (locally redundant storage)  
  - **Create Option:** `Empty`  
  - **Disk Size:** taken from variable  
- No need to attach the disks to the VM
